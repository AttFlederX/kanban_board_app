## Trends in modern software development

- Increasing platform fragmentation
- Rising demand for unified codebases
- AI tools increasing expectations for speed & quality
- Businesses prioritizing performance and seamless UX
- Microservices as a preferred way of ensuring scalability

## Cross-platform vs. Web-only

- Cross-platform
  - Native performance
  - Full access to device capabilities
- Web-only:
  - Low entry barrier
  - Capabilities & performance limited by browser

Latest generation of cross-platform frameworks aims to target as many platforms as possible with fewest compromises

## Framework options

- Flutter: Single codebase, fully rendered UI
- React Native: JS/TS, native components
- .NET MAUI: C#/XAML, native components
- Electron: JS/TS, desktop only

## Key features of Flutter

- Google’s modern UI toolkit for building apps on any device
- Produces fully native apps
- Pixel-by-pixel rendering with a high-performance engine
- Strong ecosystem, tooling, and community

# Microservice setup with Go and MongoDB

- **Backend:** Go (Fiber) — fast, efficient, and highly concurrent; ideal for scalable microservices and real-time APIs
- **Data:** MongoDB — flexible schema, easy scaling, and powerful querying;
- **Integration:** Go’s strong MongoDB drivers enable seamless data access and rapid iteration
- **Deploy:** Docker Compose for local development, Kubernetes for robust, production-grade orchestration

## Use case: To-Do List

- Flutter Kanban board UI for mobile, web & desktop
- Fiber backend with REST API & WebSockets
- MongoDB database with indexed collections for users & tasks
- Local backup for offline access

## Business impact

**Accelerate Delivery**  
Launch faster with a single UI codebase for all platforms.

**Reduce Costs**  
Leverage shared skills and unified tooling to lower development expenses.

**Ensure Consistency**  
Deliver a seamless, accessible user experience everywhere.

**Scale Confidently**  
Grow effortlessly with a microservices architecture.

## Conclusion & Q&A

### Key Takeaways

- **Unified Development:** Flutter enables building for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Modern Backend:** Go and MongoDB provide a scalable, efficient, and flexible backend for real-world apps.
- **Business Value:** Cross-platform solutions accelerate delivery, reduce costs, and ensure consistent UX.
